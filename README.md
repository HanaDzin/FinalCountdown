## 📚 Key React Concepts and Techniques  

### 🪝 Refs  
- **Refs** provide a way to access DOM elements directly.  
- Unlike state, updates to refs do not re-trigger component re-renders.  
- Used for tasks like direct input element access (`nameRef.current.value`) or managing timers independently in each component instance.  

### 🔄 Refs vs State  
- **State**: Best for UI-related dynamic data.  
- **Refs**: Ideal for accessing elements or persistent data across renders.  
- Example: Using refs for timer control ensures independent handling across multiple components.  

### 🌀 Forwarding Refs  
- Forwarding refs allows passing a ref through a component to access DOM elements in child components.  
- Combined with `<dialog>` and `useImperativeHandle` to expose APIs like `.open()` for modal dialogs while keeping components decoupled.  

### ✨ Portals  
- Portals enable rendering components outside the parent DOM hierarchy.  
- In this app, portals are used to enhance UI layers, like dialogs appearing above other elements.
